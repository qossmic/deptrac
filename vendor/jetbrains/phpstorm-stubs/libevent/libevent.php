/**

 * set in the 'what' argument to the callback function when a timeout
 * has occurred.

/**
 * Indicates that the event is persistent.
 *
 * By default, whenever a pending event becomes active
 * (because its fd is ready to read or write, or because its timeout expires),
 * it becomes non-pending right before its callback is executed.
 * Thus, if you want to make the event pending again, you can call event_add()
 * on it again from inside the callback function.
 *
 * If the EV_PERSIST flag is set on an event, however, the event is persistent.
 * This means that event remains pending even when its callback is activated.
 * If you want to make it non-pending from within its callback, you can call
 * event_del() on it.
 *
 * The timeout on a persistent event resets whenever the event's callback runs.
 * Thus, if you have an event with flags EV_READ|EV_PERSIST and a timeout of five
 * seconds, the event will become active:
 *
 * Whenever the socket is ready for reading.
 *
 * Whenever five seconds have passed since the event last became active.
