/**
 * ### Unbuffered Channels
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * An unbuffered channel will block on calls to @see Channel::send() until there is a receiver, and block on calls
 * to @see Channel::recv() until there is a sender. This means an unbuffered channel is not only a way to share
 * data among tasks but also a simple method of synchronization.
 *
 *  An unbuffered channel is the fastest way to share data among tasks, requiring the least copying.
 *
 * ### Buffered Channels
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  A buffered channel will not block on calls to @see Channel::send() until capacity is reached, calls to
 * @see Channel::recv() will block until there is data in the buffer.
 *
 * ### Closures over Channels
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A powerful feature of parallel channels is that they allow the exchange of closures between tasks (and runtimes).
 *
 * When a closure is sent over a channel the closure is buffered, it doesn't change the buffering of the channel
 *     transmitting the closure, but it does effect the static scope inside the closure: The same closure sent to
 *     different runtimes, or the same runtime, will not share their static scope.
 *
 * This means that whenever a closure is executed that was transmitted by a channel, static state will be as it was
 *     when the closure was buffered.
 *
 * ### Anonymous Channels
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The anonymous channel constructor allows the programmer to avoid assigning names to every channel: parallel will
 *     generate a unique name for anonymous channels.
