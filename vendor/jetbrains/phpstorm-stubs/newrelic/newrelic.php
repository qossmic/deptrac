 * INI settings to associate your application to the desired name at the start of execution.
 *
 * If you cannot edit your agent config file (for example, many shared hosting environments do not allow you to edit
 * config files), the newrelic_set_appname API call can be used to configure app name, license key (optional, for if
 * you use multiple accounts), and a true/false flag (optional, to determine whether to keep or discard previously

 * all current transaction data and start a new transaction after it has reconnected with the given app name.
 *
 * For other app-naming options, see Name your PHP application. When possible, INI-based solutions are recommended.
 *
 * New Relic highly recommends that you call this function as soon as possible and in as shallow of a call stack as
 * possible. Applications are discrete entities in APM, and discontinuity of transaction traces is inherent to this
 * method's usage. After connecting with the new app name, the new transactions start reporting to the new application
 * without the context of the previous application or the data that has been reported to it.
