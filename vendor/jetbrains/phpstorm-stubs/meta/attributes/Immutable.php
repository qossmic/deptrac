/**
 * Mark a property (or all class properties in the case of a class) as immutable.
 * By default, an IDE highlights write accesses on such properties if they are located outside a constructor (this scope is customizable, see below).
 *
 * You can provide a custom allowed write scope by using the following values:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Immutable::CONSTRUCTOR_WRITE_SCOPE}: write is allowed only in containing class constructor (default choice)</li>
 * <li>{@link Immutable::PRIVATE_WRITE_SCOPE}: write is allowed only in places where the property would be accessible if it had 'private' visibility modifier</li>
 * <li>{@link Immutable::PROTECTED_WRITE_SCOPE}: write is allowed only in places where the property would be accessible if it had 'protected' visibility modifier</li>
 * </ul>
