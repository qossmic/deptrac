## `analyzer`

### `count_use_statements`

By default, deptrac will analyze all occurrences for classes, including `use`
statements. If you would like to exempt `use` statements from the analysis, you
can change this behaviour in the depfile:

```yaml
analyzer:
  count_use_statements: false
```

## `baseline`

You can define a baseline, i.e. existing violations that should not fail a build. The `baseline` option takes the filename where the baseline is defined.

Example:

```
baseline: 'deptrac.baseline.yaml'
```

## `exclude_files`

With `exclude_files` you can specify a list of regular expressions for excluding
certain files in your path. If any part of the file path matches a regexp
defined here, than it will not be collected and added to your layers.

Example:

```yaml
exclude_files:
  - '#.*Test\.php$#'
```

## `formatters`

Some formatters can be configured to change their output for different purposes.
For more info on formatters see [Formatters](formatters.md).

### `graphviz`

You can configure the graphviz output by hiding layers from the output or by
grouping them.

#### `groups`

You can group multiple layers.

Example:

```yaml
layers:
  - User Frontend
  - User Backend
  - Admin Frontend
  - Admin Backend
formatters:
  graphviz:
    groups:
      User:
        - User Frontend
        - User Backend
      Admin:
        - Admin Frontend
        - Admin Backend
```

The resulting output will look like this:
![GraphvizGroups](../examples/GraphvizGroups.png)

#### `hidden_layers`

You can hide layers from the generated output. These layers will still be
analyzed and violations will be reported, but they might no longer be visible in
the generated image.

Example:

```yaml
formatters:
  graphviz:
    hidden_layers:
      - Controller
```

## `imports`

If your depfile configuration becomes too large, you can split it up into
multiple files that can then be imported in the main depfile using the `imports`
section.

Example:

```yaml
imports:
  - some/depfile.yaml
```

## `ignore_uncovered_internal_classes`

By default, PHP internal classes will not be reported as uncovered, if they are
not covered by a layer. If you want to change this behavior, you can set this
option to false.

Example:

```yaml
ignore_uncovered_internal_classes: false
```

## `layers`

For more details on layers see the [Concepts](concepts.md#layers) documentation.

Example:

```yaml
layers:
  -
    name: Controller
    collectors:
      -
        type: className
        regex: .*Controller.*
```

### `name`

Each layer must have a unique name. You can use special characters, e.g. `()` in
your names. The YAML format sometimes tries to convert certain characters into
types, so you might want to make sure that they are interpreted as string by
enclosing the whole name in single quotes, e.g. `'Controller'`.

### `collectors`

For a list of available collectory and their configuration format see
[Collectors](collectors.md).

## `parameters`

Deptrac provides parameters that can be user in your confiugration.

* `%currentWorkingDirectory%` The path Deptrac runs in
* `%depfileDirectory%` The path where the depfile is stored.

You can specify your own parameters and reuse them in your configuration:

Example:

```yaml
parameters:
  Project: MyProject

layers:
  -
    name: Foo
    collectors:
      -
        type: implements
        implements: '%Project%\SomeInterface'
```

## `paths`

The `path` option takes a list of directories, that Deptrac should analyze. In
most cases, this is where your project's source files are located. You could
also add the vendor/ directory if you want to collect any vendor files in layers
as well.

Example:

```yaml
paths:
  - src/
  - vendor/
```

## `ruleset`

A ruleset is a list of layer names, which again take a list of layer names.

Example:

```yaml
ruleset:
  Controller:
    - Service
  Service:
    - Repository
  Repository: ~
```

## `skip_violations`

With `skip_violations` you can tell your CI pipeline to not fail, when the
listed violations are encountered. For more on this see
[Concepts](concepts.md#violations).

Example:

```yaml
skip_violations:
  Library\LibClass:
    - Core\CoreClass
```

## `use_relative_path_from_depfile`

By default, all paths in the configuration are assumed to be relative to the depfile they are defined in. If you want to change this behavior set this option to false.

Example:

```yaml
use_relative_path_from_depfile: false
```
